<p>i am raziel! in the past, i've gone by more than a dozen different names, as my sense of identity is about as stable as wet cardboard. i started out my interneting back when i was but a leetle creatcher, sometime in 2012. i spent most of my times on girl game websites (rip games2girls, you were a real one), youtube, and everyone's favorite website, good ol' deviantART. these days, i do just about the same, just with a lot less girl game websites, as flash is extremely dead. thank god for emulators, amirite?</p>
<p>my interests tend to revolve around anything electronic, whether that be the music genre, or some kind of computery-type thing. i'm also an enthusiast of dead dove content. i've been in fandom for all my internet-life, and making fictional characters suffer through all kinds of torture is my favorite passtime. heart emoji.</p>
<p>being disabled, i don't do anything for work besides the very occasional art commission. speaking of which, i've been drawing since the early 2010s. like most people, i started out drawing traditionally, then moved onto digital once i was able to acquire a tablet. i tend to focus my talents on nostalgic pieces, as those bring me the most comfort. also a LOT of weird gory stuff. it's fun 4 me. ^_^</p>
<p>socially speaking, i am very horrible at talking to people. XD given past relationships, i'm pretty selective on who i associate with. i prefer to keep to myself rather than go out and make friends. some may call it lonely, but whatever. :P so, if we are in contact, and i randomly stop talking to you for weeks on end, please don't take it personally! you are not the only one lololol</p>
