<p>qymaen abuse hour (which lasts much longer than an hour)</p>
<p>i&rsquo;ll admit, this AU has never been fully fleshed out. the last time i even gave it any thought was 2017, maybe 2018. also, most of the things i&rsquo;ve written about it have been lost to time (and faulty desktop computers). forgive me if it&rsquo;s a little vague in parts.</p>
<p>summary: instead of grievous&rsquo; shuttle being sabotaged by dooku&rsquo;s agents, the kaleesh warrior was instead kidnapped, and isolated and tortured into submission by the evil count. lol</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the kidnapping of Grievous, he was confined to a small living quarters somewhere within the Separatist Senate Building. The room was empty and featureless save for a large window that took up half of the far wall.
<blockquote>Later on, this room would eventually contain a dull pink blanket, one that would also eventually be stained with Grievous&rsquo; blood. Can&rsquo;t forget the scratches on the window and walls, either.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>When the Kaleesh warlord was first captured, he naturally put up a fight. Even with his bonds keeping him from physically attacking anyone, his mind was strong, and he was determined to not bend to Dooku&rsquo;s will.</li>
<li>Though he had been severely beaten, half-starved, and psychologically tormented, it had taken Dooku more than a year to eventually wear Grievous down. Of course, Grievous would never fully submit.
<blockquote>One of Dooku&rsquo;s favorite methods of discipline included cutting. Deep scars line Grievous&rsquo; arms, legs, chest, and various other parts of his body have minor scars on them.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Though exhaustion had taken his ability to move as quickly or as agile as he had before, he still had quite a mouth.</li>
<li>The relationship between the pair is&hellip; a bit complex.</li>
<li>On one hand, Grievous despises Dooku. He wants nothing more than to tear the old man&rsquo;s throat out with his teeth, and- well, you get the idea. On the other hand, there&rsquo;s something simply intoxicating about him, and the way he treats him.
<blockquote>After certain sessions of discipline, Dooku would be surprisingly caring towards Grievous. The count would offer praise, kind words of affection, and he would mend Grievous&rsquo; wounds, cleaning and bandaging his limbs so gently and carefully that Grievous almost found it hard to believe this had been the same person who had tormented him for so long.</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Dooku isn&rsquo;t all that certain about his feelings related to Grievous either. On one hand, he knows that the only reason Grievous is even in his possession is due to his master&rsquo;s wishes and plans for the warlord, but he can&rsquo;t help but feel&hellip; <em>something</em> towards him.</li>
<li>Is it love? Probably not. It&rsquo;s more like a&nbsp;<span class="hgKElc">S</span>tockholm syndrome mixed with Lima syndrome type of situation.</li>
<li>Oh, and yes, in case you were wondering: They <em>do</em> fuck.</li>
