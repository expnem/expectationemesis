<h1>frequently asked questions</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong><strong>what do you use to draw? -&nbsp;</strong></strong>paint tool SAI v2 and wacom cintiq 16 (DTK-1660</li>
<li><strong>why did you create your AUs? -&nbsp;</strong>to cope with past traumas and to explore concepts and situations. my work isn&rsquo;t for everyone haha</li>
<li><strong>can i request art from you? - </strong>as long as it relates in someway to my AUs, feel free! my knowledge of star wars these days is very limited, though. :P haven't watched anything past season 3 of SWR.</li>
<li><strong>where can i see your old artwork?</strong> - if you&rsquo;d like to see something in particular, please send me and ask or direct message. i have 99% of my work saved on my harddrive, so i probably still have it.</li>
</ol>
<p>and to clear up any other confusion, this blog isn&rsquo;t the first iteration of mechanicalanakal. the original blog was deleted in august of 2022. most of my old SWR art was deleted multiple years prior to that. i used to be ashamed of my creations. i am not anymore. :3</p>
