<p>self harm AU (+ bonus abusive parents, yippee!)</p>

<p>the from 2016 has long since been forgotten. what follows is a rewritten version.</p>

<p>summary: ezra bridger is a cutter. that’s the long and short of it.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<ul>
<li>This habit stemmed from early childhood. He would scratch and bite himself (usually his hands/fingers, as those were most easily accessed) whenever he was feeling stressed, overwhelmed, etc.</li>
<li>He learned early on that this was something he had to hide (or something that he wasn’t supposed to do, wasn’t normal, y'know). He had only been caught by his parents a few times, but the times they had caught him, they punished him.</li>
<li>That was also around the time he learned to fear his parents’ looming gaze, a primal fear that would stay with him for years to come.</li>
<li>Instead of biting his hands, Ezra would claw at his arms, being careful to have long sleeves cover up whatever damage he had done. As time went on, he would eventually graduate to using a blade instead of his fingernails.</li>
<li>For the years following the imprisonment of his parents, while Ezra’s focus had remained elsewhere (trying to stay alive on his own) for the most part, there were times when he would resort to old habits in order to calm himself.</li>
<li>Meeting up with the Ghost Crew had thrown him for a loop, and he quickly found himself back to cutting himself regularly to cope with the new situation.</li>
<li>It being such a private matter, Ezra is very secretive about his cutting, and none of the crew are aware of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fluffy bonus point: Ezra has a childhood stuffed animal that he carries around, a plush loth cat that he named Sparky.</p>
