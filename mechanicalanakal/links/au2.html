<p><i>other</i> abuse AU</p>

<p>OKAY archive.org did snag one of my old AUs. this one being the hera-focused abuse one. tis a shame it’s only this one, but at least it’s something! everything below the cut is from 2016, so please excuse the… *gestures vaguely* poor writing/wording/etc. i was a very stupid 15 year old. :P</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p>hera was bound to break eventually. here it is, a sub au of a sub au. no, i’m not going to make a inception joke. no, i’m going to make a math joke. that’s sub au², fuckers, strap yourselves in.</p>

<ul>
<li>so, the au is pretty much that other abusive au, but with hera.</li>
<li>ezra is hesitant to tell anyone because he doubts anyone would believe him.</li>
<li>similar to kanan, hera acts as she should whenever the two are not alone. hera acts as motherly as she usually is, but is cruel whenever alone.</li>
<li>ezra on good terms with kanan and tries to stick with him as much as he possibly can, even going as far as to following around so he’s not alone with hera.</li>
<li>kanan has tried to get ezra to talk about what’s bothering him, but is never told about what’s happening. ezra knows how close hera is to him, and he believes kanan wouldn’t believe him for that reason.</li>
<li>despite that, kanan can tell that something is wrong. he knows something is bothering his padawan, but no matter what he does, kanan can’t get ezra to tell him.</li>
<li>hera doesn’t do anything cruel towards ezra when she knows either someone is going to be around, or she knows ezra is going to make a noise. she tries her best to be as careful with this as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>updated as of 11/11/16 / more will be added whenever i can!</p>
