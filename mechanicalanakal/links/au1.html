<p>abuse AU - sub AU of the self harm one.</p>

<p>the original text from the 2016 version has long since been forgotten. as such, what follows is a rewritten version.</p>

<p>summary: kanan turns out not to be the father figure ezra needs in his life.</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<ul>
<li>Around the others, Kanan is his usual jovial self, treats Ezra as a kind mentor should. Kanan’s true colors only come out when the two of them are alone.</li>
<li>Kanan is verbally and psychologically abusive towards Ezra.</li>
<li>Particularly, he tends to degrade Ezra for self-harming despite the care and attention he’s been given. Kanan gets physically violent with him, beating the poor kid up. When Ezra cries, Kanan tells him to ‘shut up, or I’ll give you a reason to cry’.</li>
<li>Sparky isn’t immune to Kanan’s abuse either. In order to terrorize Ezra, he’ll tear the poor loth cat’s head off, cut it to bits, etc. Ezra is often left to pick up the pieces, and fix the plush on his own.</li>
<li>Ezra wants to tell the others about the abuse he faces from Kanan, but isn’t sure how to. He’s doubtful they would trust him, knowing how close the rest of the crew are. Beyond that, Ezra also feels like he should be grateful he was even allowed to stay with the Ghost crew, so the last thing he wants to do is rock the boat, so to speak.</li>
<li>Still, he can’t keep quiet about it forever. So, the first person he ever tells anything about this to is Sabine. Being the closest to age in him, and seeing how well they tend to get along, Ezra feels safest coming to her first.</li>
<li>Of course, he didn’t just outright tell her what was going on. He kept it as vague as possible, explaining that he’d been having some issues with Kanan, that he was unsure about his mentorship, etc. Sabine listens, tries to offer advice, but ultimately is unable to do much of anything for him.</li>
<li>Ezra’s attempts to get any assistance from Hera or Zeb go about the same. They offer what minimal support they can, given the lack of full context, but that’s all they can do.</li>
</ul>
