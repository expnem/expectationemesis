<p><b>commissions are:</b> closed indefinitely. thank you so much!</p>

<p>- - -</p>

<p><b>terms of service</b></p>
<ol><li>i won't create commissions for anyone under the age of 18, safe for work or otherwise.</li><br>
<li>i have the right to decline any commission that comes my way for any reason, and i also have the right to not disclose why i've chosen to decline.</li><br>
<li>i take payment primarily over paypal. however, i'm also willing to accept gift cards of equal or close-enough-to-equal amounts (amazon or ebay, preferably). i won't take any form of cryptocurrency.</li><br>
<li>i <i>do not</i> consent to my artwork being used for nfts. do not commission me with this intent.</li><br>
<li>there is an extra fee if you want to sell your commission/use it for merchandise or advertising purposes. the sum of your total will double.</li><br>
<li>additional characters, no matter the option chosen, will add $10 to the final price <i>per character</i>.</li><br>
<li>i am willing to do private commissions (as in the artwork won't be posted to social media), however please keep in mind that i reserve the right to use your commission in my portfolio. <i>please state that you want your commission to be private in your first message.</i></li><br>
<li>if your order contains a character you don't own the rights to, please be ready with written permission from the character's owner.</li><br>
<li>while it's likely your file won't be deleted from my hard drive for a while, it is recommended that you save your commission in multiple places so you don't lose it.</li><br>
<li>if you decide to post your commission to a social media account, please credit me by linking back to <a href="https://expectationemesis.net/">https://expectationemesis.net/</a></li><br>
<li><i>i will not refund your commission if i have already started.</i> the only time i will go against this rule is if my circumstances have changed and/or i don't feel confident i will be able to give you a finished product for any reason.</li>
</ol>

<b>by commissioning me, you have agreed to the above conditions.</b>

<p>- - -</p>

<p><b>things to consider before ordering</b></p>
<ol>
<li>i struggle with chronic pain. so, depending on how much my pain is bothering me, that may affect the time it takes for me to complete your commission. generally, i get commissions done fairly quickly - perhaps a day or two - however, there have been times where it's taken me longer.</li><br>
<li>i'm not very good at backgrounds. that's just something i have to improve on. i work best with characters being the main subject of a piece, and if there is a background, it is a pattern or single color.</li><br>
<li>generally, i prefer if discussion takes place over discord. however, you're free to email me if that is preferred. discord: scardonia. email: razzyscardonia[at]aol[dot]com.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>how to order from me <s>(and not confuse us both)</s></b></p>
<ol>
<li>read this page very carefully, particularly the terms of service section.</li><br>
<li>send me a dm stating the following:</li><br>
<dd><li>the type of commission you want (ex. flat color, page doll, etc.).</li><br>
<li>a prompt of  what you want me to draw.</li><br>
<li>the needed character(s) reference  sheet(s).</li><br>
<li>the style you want (lineart, coloring,  etc.) -- link to certain pieces of mine. if you have no preference, don't worry about this step!</li></dd><br>
<li>after discussion takes place, and i give the ok, i'll send over my paypal link. i won't start working on your commission until you pay me, unless you'd feel more comfortable sending half the payment first, then the other half after i finish the art.</li><br>
<li>once paid, i will start working. i will be updating you whenever i finish a portion of the piece (ex. sketch done, progress pic sent. lines done, progress pic sent. etc.).<br><b>important:</b> during the sketching and lining phase, you're free to ask for small changes. once i'm onto coloring, i won't make any further changes <i>unless</i> i make a mistake -- it happens! i am only human. </li><br>
<li>once i deem the piece finished on my end, i will send you a copy. if you don't see anything that needs changed, we're all done! after we've both agreed that the piece is finished, i will not do any further edits on it.</li>
</ol>

<p><font color="00b43f"><b>&check; can do, boss :D &check;</b></font> - <i>i work best with...</i><br>
furries (anthro or feral), My Little Pony OCs, humanoids, cyborgs/androids, light/suggestive NSFW, blood/gore, monsters/creatures.</p>
<p><font color="ffe752"><b>~ ehhhhh maybe, boss &lt;:/ ~</b></font> - <i>i <b>could</b> draw...</i><br>
real people (with enough references?), scalies, not-so-light NSFW (i am often sex repulsed), shipping (OCxOC, OCxcanon, etc.).</p>
<p><font color="red"><b>x no can do, boss d: x</b></font> - <i>i refuse to draw...</i><br>
reference sheets, NSFW of real people, complex machinery, backgrounds, characters from certain media (if your commission happens to include such media, i will let you know).</p>
<p>this isn't an exhaustive list, as you can tell. if you have any questions about what i am/am not willing to draw, don't be afraid to ask!</p>
<p>though it doesn't appear on the menu below, i also take <b>character design</b> commissions. that's the one and only time i'll ever go against my own guidelines. :P pricing them is somewhat complicated, and i will need to send you multiple images along the way so that you receive the best design i can manage, so much discussion will need to go down. not to worry though, designs generally won't go over $50.</p>
